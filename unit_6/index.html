<!-- 	1) Why does the reset.css link seem to need ../ but style.css doesn't?
     
		2) Which is preferred using reset.css or 
		* {
			margin: 0;
			padding: 0;
			box-sizing: border-box; 
		}  

		3) Sublime doesn't seem to recognize box-sizing unless I have the wrong property:value 

		4) How long would the reset.css file used in this class be valid, e.g. how long before a new best practice or method would make this invalid?

<!-- 	1) Where can I find help on how to randomly rotate through a series of a dozen or so images where I've placed this figure?
