<!-- BEGIN QUESTIONS ***************************

1) Which is preferred <br> or </br>?

2) What's the preferred method for bolding/emphasizing just a few words in a paragraph? I used <strong> since it was referenced in the lesson?? 

3) When I ran this page through the W3C validator I got 2 'info' notifications about content-type and schema...  not sure what they meant?

4) Do 'info' messages in the W3C validator need to be addressed?

5) Where could I find help on how to randomly rotate through a series of a dozen or so images on the homepage? And, what's a good method for trying to do this knowing if images sizes may vary?

6) What's the preferred method for providing links to Google maps when you want to offer directions?

7) Where can I find info on preferred ASCII characters for sybmols like ampersand and copyright?
